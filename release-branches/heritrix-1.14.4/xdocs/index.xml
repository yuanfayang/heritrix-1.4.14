        <p>Heritrix is the Internet Archive's open-source, extensible, 
        	web-scale, archival-quality web crawler project.</p>
        	
        <p><em>Heritrix</em> (sometimes spelled <em>heretrix</em>, or 
        misspelled or mis-said as <em>heratrix</em>/<em>heritix</em>/
        <em>heretix</em>/<em>heratix</em>) is an 
        archaic word for <em>heiress</em> (woman who inherits). Since our 
        crawler seeks to collect and <i>preserve</i> the digital
        artifacts of our culture for the benefit of future researchers and
        generations, this name seemed apt.</p>

        <p>Heritrix is designed to respect the

        <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#meta">META robots

        to disrupt normal website activity.

<p><a href="https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Release+Notes+-+3.0.0">
3.0.0 Release Notes</a></p>

<p>Release 3.0.0 is a major release, the first of the Heritrix3 ("H3") series. 
It includes new features and issue fixes, and a significant reworking of the 
configuration system and user interface based on current and expected needs.
</p>

<p>Heritrix3 is currently suitable for advanced users and projects that are 
either customizing Heritrix (with Java or other scripting code) or embedding 
Heritrix in a larger system. Please review the Current Limitations to help 
determine if Heritrix3 or a current Heritrix1 (1.14.3 or later) release is best 
suited for your needs.</p>

<p>The 3.0.0 release is now available for download at 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/archive-crawler/files/heritrix3/3.0.0/">
the archive-crawler Sourceforge project</a>.</p>

<p>Documentation for Heritrix3 is available via the 
<a href="https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix+3.0+User+Guide">
Heritrix 3.0 User Guide</a>,

<p>Four notable differences in Heritrix 2 are:</p>

<p>(1) A more rigorous separation of the Web UI from the 'crawl engine',
giving greater flexibility to control crawlers remotely.</p>
<p>(2) A new settings system, easing module development and offering new
opportunities for dynamic configuration construction.</p>
<p>(3) A new mechanism for custom override settings for sets of related
URIs, extending beyond Heritrix 1.x's domain-centric overrides.</p>
<p>(4) A new system for ordering URIs within a single URI-queue, and for
allocating frontier effort among different URI-queues, based on assigned
integer 'precedence' values.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/2.0+Tutorial">
tutorial of starting a basic crawl</a> in the changed web UI is
available.</p>

<p>Documentation for 2.0 is still limited but will gradually improve on 
<a href="http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Home">the 
project wiki</a>. (There are now direct help links from individual web 
UI settings to actual or potential wiki pages.)</p>

    <p>Release 1.12.0 is the first of several planned releases enhancing
      Heritrix with "smart crawler" functionality. In this release, the theme
      has been offering new options to reduce the amount of duplicate content

      of other enhancements and bug fixes are also included.

    <p>This is primarily a bug-fix release, with a couple of new
      features, provided before a number of significant changes to 
      the Heritrix project that will require developer and crawl 
      operator adjustments. Post-1.10.2, Heritrix source code control, issue 
      tracking, and build process will migrate to new systems. Also, updates 
      to core classes, especially with regard to the settings architecture, 
      will noticeably break backward compatibility with 1.10.2 and prior 
      crawler settings files and formats.
