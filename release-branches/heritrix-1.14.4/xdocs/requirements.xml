    <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
		<p>The Heritrix crawler is implemented purely in java.  This means
        that the only true requirement for running it is that you have a
        JRE installed.</p>
		
		<p>The Heritrix crawler makes use of Java 5.0 features so your JRE must 
		be at least of a 5.0 (1.5.0+) pedigree.</p>
		
		<p>We currently include all of the free/open source third-party
        libraries necessary to run Heritrix in the distribution package.
        See
        <a href="http://crawler.archive.org/dependencies.html">dependencies</a>
        for the complete list (Licenses for all of the listed libraries
        are listed in the dependencies section of the raw project.xml 
        at the root of the src download or here on
        <a href="https://archive-crawler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/archive-crawler/trunk/heritrix/project.xml">sourceforge</a>).</p>

		<p>Default heap size is 256MB RAM.  This should be suitable for crawls
        that range over hundreds of hosts.</p>
	</subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Linux">
        <p>The Heritrix crawler has been built and tested primarily on Linux. 
        It has seen some informal use on Macintosh, Windows 2000 and
        Windows XP, but is not tested, packaged, nor supported on platforms
        other than Linux at this time.</p>
